Initialize local repository on your test host. Create the following branches:

##### master (init branch) 
* has 2 commits
##### dev (has been created from master)
* has 2 commits from master + 2 additional
##### features/do_one (has been created from dev branch)
* has 2 commits from master + 2 additional from dev + 1 additional
##### hotfix/we_gonna_die (has been created from master branch)
* has 2 commits from master + 1 additional commit

Play the following situations:

* Release phase - all commits should be inside master (except commits which is presented in branch hotfix)
* Hotfix deploy - commit from hotfix/we_gonna_die branch should be in master first, then in another branches too

In the end of this "play" you should provide list of your commits for all above mentioned branches. You can add this output into the final part of your report.
