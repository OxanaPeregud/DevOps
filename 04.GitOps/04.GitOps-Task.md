Need to create CI pipeline to find tabs in code

Requirements:

* run on PR
* should scan all changed files
* checking all changed files in parallel
* result of found tabs should be inside artefacts of each build

Your action yaml file add to the folder "04.GitOps" and create report in README.md file inside same folder (report contains link to your action files in same folder, links to your testing repository and log of your pipeline)
